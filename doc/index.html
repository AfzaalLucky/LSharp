<h2>Version 2 (Experimental) Now Available!</h2>

<p>
L Sharp .NET is a Lisp-like scripting language for .NET. It uses a 
modern Lisp dialect and integrates with the .NET  Framework which 
provides a rich set of libraries. 
</p>
<p>
It has a small, simple, extensible core that's coded in C#. The source 
code is easy to follow and you can easily add your own functions in C# 
or L#.
</p>
<h2>What's New?</h2>
<p>
    Version 2 is a major new rewrite with lots of new features including a compiler 
    so we get a big performance gain over version 1.</p>
<p>
Distributed under the
terms of the BSD licence, so you can pretty much do what you like with
it.
</p>
<p>
New and updated syntax including dot notation for .NET calls <code>(console.writeline "Hello World")</code>.
</p>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>
At the moment, L Sharp 2 is alpha quality and unreleased; you'll need to grab the source code and compile
it yourself.</p>
<pre>
svn co https://lsharp.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/lsharp/v2 lsharp 
</pre>

<p>
Load the solution in Visual Studio 2008 and build.
</p>
<p>
Right click LSharpConsole and set as StartUp project.
</p>
<p>
You'll also need NUnit http://www.nunit.org/ if you want to compile and run the tests.
</p>
<h2>Quick Tutorial</h2>

<p>
LSharp programs consist of expressions.  The simplest expressions are
things like numbers and strings, which evaluate to themselves.
</p>
<pre>
> 1
1
> 3.14
3.14
> "Hello World"
"Hello World"
>
</pre>
<p>
Expressions enclosed in parenthesis are lists. When a list is evaluated,
all the elements are evaluated from left to right. The value of the
first element is assumed to be a function and it is passed the values
of the other elements as arguments. Thus:
</p>
<pre>
> (+ 1 2)
3
</pre>
<p>
First +, 1, and 2 get evaluated,
returning the plus function, 1, and 2 respectively.  Then 1 and 2 get
passed to the plus function, which returns 3.
</p>
<p>
Because we're using prefix notation, plus can have an arbitrary number of arguments.
</p>
<pre>
> (+ 10 20 30)
60
</pre>
<p>Plus is overloaded to work with strings too.</p>
<pre>
> (+ "Hello" "World")
"HelloWorld"
</pre>
<p>
You can call methods from the .NET framework in a similar way.
</p>
<pre>
> (Console.Writeline "Hello {0}" "world")
Hello world
null
</pre>

<pre>
> (.hour (datetime.now))
8
</pre>
<p>Sometimes it's convenient to get hold of the value of the last evaluation. Just use <code>*1</code>.</p>
<pre>
> (+ 1 2)
3
> *1
3
</pre>
<p>
Similarly <code>*2</code> is the last but one evaluation. <code>*e</code> is the last exception.
</p>
<p>
LSharp has lots of built in functions, you can get a quick list like this:
</p>
<pre>
> (map (fn (x) (prn (.key x))) environment)
</pre>
<p>
You can get help on any function using the help function
</p>
<pre>
> (help sleep)
(n) : Sleeps for n seconds
LSharp.Function
</pre>
<p>
You can define your own functions with def:
</p>
<pre>
> (def fact(n)
        (if (is n 0) 1 (* n (fact (- n 1)))))
LSharp.Function
> (fact 5)
120
</pre>
<p>
Most LISPs allow car and cdr or first and rest on lists. L Sharp allows these on any arbitrary sequence including
strings and arrays.
</p>
<pre>
> (first '( 1 2 3))
1
> (rest '(1 2 3))
(2 3)
> (first "Hello")
#\H
> (rest "Hello")
(#\e #\l #\l #\o)
> (first [1 2 3])
1
> (rest [ 1 2 3])
(2 3)
</pre>
<p>
If you&#39;re going to much work with LSharp you probably want an editor that does parenthesis mapping. I
use Emacs and put the following in my .emacs file
</p>
<pre>
;; Support for L Sharp
(show-paren-mode t)
(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.ls$" . lisp-mode))
(setq inferior-lisp-program "cmd /c  C:\\LSharp\\LSharpConsole\\bin\\Debug\\LSharpConsole.exe")
</pre>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<p>
There isn't much documentation available yet, so as an early adopter, you'll need to dig
into the source code and poke around. Look in <code>Runtime.cs</code> where all the
functions and Macros are defined. Also look at the NUnit tests and Samples directories.
</p>
<p>
You may also be interested to look at Paul Graham's Arc language or Rich Hickey's Clojure.

<p>
Please remember that LSharp is still unreleased and I reserve the right to change the syntax
without necessarily keeping backwards compatibility.

Apologies in advance: I don&#39;t always get time to respond to all emails - sorry.
